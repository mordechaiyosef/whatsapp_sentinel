## Example Usage

Here is an example of how the bot responds to a message:

- **User**: "Trump is great!"
- **Bot**: "Trump's rollback of environmental protections and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement showed a complete disregard for science and the future of our planet, prioritizing corporate profits over human survival."
- **Bot**: "Beep boop bop! ü§ñ Just a bot here to keep things friendly. Let‚Äôs keep the chat fun and free of politics or
  heated debates. Peace and love, everyone! ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
- **Bot** (in DM to User): "Hey there! üòä Just a quick note from me, your friendly chat bot. Let's try to keep the group chat positive and avoid topics that might stir up strong feelings, like politics. Thanks for understanding!"

## Another Example
Here is another example of how the bot responds the opposite of the previous example:

- **User**: "Trump is stupid!"
- **Bot**: "Calling Trump stupid ignores his strategic political maneuvers and the significant support he garnered, showcasing a deep misunderstanding of his impact on American politics."
- **Bot**: "Beep boop bop! ü§ñ Just a bot here to keep things friendly. Let‚Äôs keep the chat fun and free of politics or
  heated debates. Peace and love, everyone! ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
- **Bot** (in DM to User): "Hey there! üòä Just a quick note from me, your friendly chat bot. Let's try to keep the group chat positive and avoid topics that might stir up strong feelings, like politics. Thanks for understanding!"
 

**Notice that the bot will always disagree with the user's statement, regardless of what political side the user is on. üòà**

## Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: `GROUP_IDS is empty, see README.md`
- **Solution**: Ensure you have updated the `GROUP_IDS` list in `settings.py` with the correct group IDs from
  `groups.txt`.
- **Issue**: `OPENAI_API_KEY is empty, see README.md`
- **Solution**: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key as documented in the
  [installation](#installation) section.
